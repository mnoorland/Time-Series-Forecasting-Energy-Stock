# Time Series Forecasting of Energy Consumption and Stock Volatility

## Project Overview
This project involves conducting time series analysis to forecast two key variables: **total fossil fuel consumption** and **Tesla stock volatility**. The project used ARIMA and VAR models to forecast fossil fuel consumption and a GARCH model to predict Tesla stock volatility. The goal was to apply advanced time series forecasting techniques and compare model performance across the energy and finance sectors.

## Objectives
- **Forecast energy consumption** using ARIMA and VAR models, incorporating seasonal patterns and economic indicators.
- **Model stock volatility** using GARCH to predict future volatility in Tesla stock returns.
- **Compare forecasts** between ARIMA and VAR models for energy consumption, and evaluate GARCH model performance for stock volatility.

## Key Features
- **ARIMA Model for Energy Consumption**: Applied ARIMA to model fossil fuel consumption, addressing seasonal variations.
- **VAR Model**: Used to incorporate economic indicators (GDP and Industrial Production Index) to enhance forecasting of energy consumption.
- **GARCH Model for Stock Volatility**: Modeled Tesla's stock volatility with a GARCH model to capture volatility persistence.
- **Visualization**: Generated time series plots, forecast comparisons, and residual diagnostics.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Gretl**: Used for statistical modeling, data analysis, and time series forecasting.
- **ARIMA/VAR Models**: Applied to forecast energy consumption.
- **GARCH Model**: Applied to predict stock volatility.

## Files Included
- **[Final Report](./Time%20Series%20for%20Finance%20&%20Economics%20-%20Max%20Noorland%20&%20Sahitya%20Chaudhary.pdf)**: Contains a detailed explanation of the models, methodology, and results.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- **Energy Consumption Data**: Time series data for total fossil fuel consumption, along with GDP and Industrial Production Index data.
- **Stock Data**: Tesla stock price and volatility data from 2022 to 2024, focusing on daily returns and volatility analysis.
